# Underlying Research

**Machine-check** is based on a novel Input-based Three-valued Abstraction Refinement framework, which allows verification of properties in branching-time logics while using model-checking with abstraction refinement, which makes it possible to verify non-trivial systems.

A preprint of the paper on the framework is available at arXiv:
 - Onderka, J., Ratschan, S. Input-based three-valued abstraction refinement (preprint). [arXiv:2408.12668](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12668) \[cs.LO\]. 2024.

The research might be too indigestible to most people (which is fine, since the point of the tool is that you shouldn't need to perfectly know what is happening underneath). For something simpler, consider this presentation:
